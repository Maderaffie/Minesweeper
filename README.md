# About

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. 

<img src="./ReadmeResources/1.png" /> 

The main goal of the game is to clear a board of mines without detonating any of them. As in the original version, you can left-click a cell to uncover it, right-click to mark the bomb or double-click to uncover adjacent cells.

Watch out for the mines - if you hit one, you lose.
